# Problem Statement
1. The growing volume of waste in modern societies poses serious environmental and
economic challenges. Efficient waste management is essential to mitigate these impacts, and waste sorting—categorizing waste for proper disposal or recycling—is
a critical component. However, many communities face difficulties with effective
waste sorting due to insufficient awareness, inadequate infrastructure, and complex
sorting procedures.
2. The challenges brought by increasing waste are particularly significant in our college,
GCIT. The high volume of waste generated by students has made proper waste
management a pressing issue.
3. Recognizing the need for a sustainable solution, we are going to develop a waste
sorting assistant system. This initiative aims to streamline waste management

# Aims
To enhance waste sorting accuracy and efficiency by integrating the assistant with
current waste management systems, reducing contamination, and boosting recycling
rates

# Objectives
1. To design and implement a computer vision algorithm capable of identifying and
classifying various waste materials, including plastics, metals, paper, and organic
waste, with high accuracy.
2. To develop a user-friendly interface for the waste sorting assistant that provides
clear instructions, ensuring ease of use and effective interaction with the system.
